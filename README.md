# Data Processing and Storage Assignment

## Running the Code

To run this code locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arwendowers/data-processing.git
```
```bash
cd data-processing
```
### 1. Use Python Interpreter
Make sure you have the Python interpreter installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```
If you don't have it installed, then download if from the Python official website.
### 2. Run the Code
Make sure you're in the same directory as the code in your terminal. Then, depending on which one you installed, run one of the following commands to start the code:
```bash
python database.py
```
or
```bash
python3 database.py
```


## Future Modification Suggestions
I think this assignment can be improved to become an official assignment in the future by adding methods, like delete(key), to test additional transaction functionality. I also think there could be more examples about edge cases, such as conflicting keys or invalid key types. This assignment could also be improved by giving us clear unit tests to make sure our code is working properly. The given example code could also be turned into pseudocode that works for multiple programming languages since the assignment is open to any language.
